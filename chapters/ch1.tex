\chapter{Fundamentals}

Nearly every equation in the active inference literature may be obtained by following the steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define the probability distributions and factorizations of the generative model.
    \item Use generative model factors to determine probabilistic form of variational free energy.
    \item Replace probabilistic form of variational free energy with equations for corresponding probability distributions and simplify the equation.
    \item Take the partial derivative of variational free energy with respect to a variable of interest.
    \item Set this partial derivative equal to zero and solve for the variable of interest.
\end{enumerate}

In this chapter we introduce the basic concepts at play in active inference and give a more detailed explanation of how these steps are applied.
